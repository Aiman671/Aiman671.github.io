                        Hello and Assalamualaikum, my name is Muhammad Aiman Adli Bin Kahar. I am a Computer Science student. I started my
                        study at UiTM Kedah, Diploma in Computer Science and Mathematics. After graduated, I continue my study at UiTM
                        Shah Alam, Bachelor of Computer Science (Hons.) Netcentric Computing. Currently, I am a Part 3 student and still
                        studying. The purpose of this blog is I want to talk about myself as requested by my ITT501 lecturer
                        Profesor Madya Dr Nor Shahniza Kamal Bashah.

                    <p>
                        Computer Science is one of the course that is really going up these days since technology is getting better day
                        by day. With how technology grows, I think study in Computer Science will never be the waste of time. In fact,
                        it will be a good investment for your future. So far, Computer Science is actually kinda fun to learn, but it
                        need a passion and real hardwork in order to success in this course. I hope, after I graduate, I get a job that
                        I want one day.

                        <b>What is cyber attacks?</b>
                        <br>
                        Cyber attacks is an assault launched by cybercriminals using one or more computers against a single
                        or multiple computers or networks. A cyber attack can maliciously disable computers, steal data, or
                        use a breached computer as a launch point for other attacks.
                        <br><br>
                        The Israel-Palestine issues is started since a long time ago. But this latest attacks, Israel really cross
                        the line. Malaysia is a country that supports Palestine, and it triggers the Malaysian people with the
                        attacks on Palestine. This time, it really hits hard for the Palestinian people. Malaysian people can't just
                        sit down and relax, we stand with Palestine. Indonesia is also stand with Palestine. So what did Malaysia and
                        Indonesia do based on the attack on Israel?
                        <br>
                        Malaysia and Indonesia form a hacking team which is <b>AnonGhost x DragonForce Malaysia x All Hacking Team
                        Malaysia</b> to fight against Israel by hacking their database.

                            <p><b>Malaysia collab with Indonesia hacking Israel database</b></p>
                        </center>
                        I think this attacks will triggers the Israel government because this shows that the Israel system is weak and
                        can be easily hacked. With this attacks on the Israel database, Israel will realise that Malaysian and
                        Indonesian hackers is really good and will make them scared. For me personally, the attacks really useful, 
                        because we Israel has been attacking and killing innocent people and childrens on Palestine since 1947 and present.
                        This attacks will never end until Palestine give up their land to Israel. Israel is not even a country, the land
                        that they own is a Palestine land and they just took it by killing and attacks on Palestine.

                        </center>
                        With this hacking team, we must teach the Israel that they did not own every land on Palestine. This is the least
                        we can do to stand with Palestine and tell Israel that they are not fighting against one country but againts the
                        whole world. A lot of country that stands with Palestine not just Malaysia and Indonesia. Besides that, they also hack
                        the <b>public cctv systems</b> which is a live view cctv from the Israelian people during the Palestinian attacks.
                        <br><br>

                        </center>
                        This will trigger the Israel citizens that will make them feel insecure due to the cctv hacks. This maybe, yeah maybe will
                        make the Israel citizens protest to their government to stop the attacks on the Palestine because they have been watched by the
                        hackers. But personally, I think Israel will continue the attacks until they conquer all the Palestine lands. But, this attacks
                        done by DragonForce Malaysia is good because after they attacks the government data, they attacks the citizens. It will make
                        they all scared for the next attacks because the hackers is one step ahead of the Israel. Besides that, Malaysia not just
                        do cybersecurity attacks on Israel, they also cyberbully Israel.

                        </center>
                        Cyberbully is also an attack that will attacks the Israel citizens by shaming them. Some of the cyberbully is based
                        on the true facts about Palestine-Israel issues and spamming it on the social media, some of it just throw bad words
                        to the Israel citizens and soldiers. For me, this attacks is useful also, because it will make the Israel citizien and
                        soldiers mentally abused since most of the Israel citizen including the soldiers have an active social media accounts. For your
                        information, Israel soldiers have an Instagram verified account, it shows that they all is an active user on social media. By this,
                        they will read the posts or comments and will feel mentally abused by the Malaysian citizens. This shows that Malaysian cyberbullying
                        is working because Israel is now "koyak" with Malaysia. Just to let you know that Malaysia is very very good at cyberbullying.
                        Malaysia ranks 2nd in Asia for cyberbullying, <a href="https://says.com/my/news/malaysia-ranks-2nd-in-asia-for-cyberbullying-among-children">
                        click here</a> for more information. But personally for me, the cyberbullying must have limit in order to keep the good name of
                        Malaysia. This is the least for Malaysian citizens can do to stand with Palestine besides of donating to Palestine. In conclusion, I think
                        these 2 attacks is working and will make Israel realise that they are not against only one country but whole world are against Israel.
                        In Islam Allah promise one thing, which is one day, Israel will get their punishment for their act, and Islam will win. Calling out all
                        Malaysian citizens to do our part and do our best we can to help Palestine, lets all pray for our Palestine brothers and sisters, may
                        they all stay strong.
