                                    Two of the ingredients commonly found in curry powder are cardamom and sweet basil,
                                    both of which are vasodilators. They affect the proteins that reduce the tension in the blood vessels. This leads
                                    to a reduction in blood pressure, which reduces the chances of many cardiovascular conditions, including atherosclerosis,
                                    heart attacks, and strokes.

                                    Significant amounts of animal testing have shown turmeric to greatly increase the speed of
                                    bone regrowth, connectivity, and repair, while reducing signs of bone loss by up to 50%. This could mean a very powerful
                                    boost to your bones, particularly as you age, in addition to a dietary regimen packed with essential vitamins and minerals.

                                    A final beneficial element found in the majority of curry powder throughout the world is
                                    coriander, which has a well-researched penchant for fighting off bacterial infections, particularly E. [9] coli, and other
                                    severely damaging intestinal infections. Therefore, eating a healthy amount of curry powder can increase the health of your
                                    digestive system, and keep your immune system strong in its defense against bacterial agents.
